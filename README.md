CIS 350 Project - Android App That Is Essentially Craigslist For Penn

BensList is an app that serves as a CraigsList for the Penn community members (students, faculty, etc.).  Users are able to buy and sell both items and services such as books, furniture, moving services, and tutoring. The app allows users to search for items in a meaningful way by providing intuitive categorization. Additionally, the app store users\' personal relevant information including past sales and purchases and contact information. Our team (JP Quinn, Tyler Douglas, Max Doppelt, and Josh Ross) is working hard every day to enhance the users\' experience.
